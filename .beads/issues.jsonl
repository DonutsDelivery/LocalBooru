This is insecure.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Change default `auth_required_level` from `\"none\"` to `\"local_network\"`\n2. This means auth will be required when accessing from local network or public internet\n3. Localhost access will remain unauthenticated by default\n\n## Files to modify\n- `api/routers/settings.py` - line 91, change default value\n\n## Notes\n- This is a simple one-line change\n- Existing users with explicit settings won't be affected\n- New installations will be more secure by default\n- Depends on: auth middleware being implemented first (otherwise this setting still does nothing)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-19T18:04:53.703907961+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-19T18:09:09.04830642+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T18:09:09.04830642+01:00"}
